## hashcrypt

Modular block encryption based upon a secure hash function. Very experimental, not suitable for production.

## Round Description

Given a key k, for each 256-bit block in the plaintext, p_1, p_2, p_3 . . .

the ciphertext c_1 := H(k) xor p_1 and each encrypted block is defined recursively:

c_n := H(n|H(n|c_{n-1})|H(n|k)) xor p_n where H(x) is a secure hash function.

The function c_n = R(p_n)

## Iterating rounds
Rounds can be successively applied like so, up until the nth round where n less than or equal to the number of blocks needed to encrypt:

Round 1: R(p_1), R(p_2), R(p_3) . . .
Round 2: R(p_1), R(R(p_2)), R(R(p_3)) . . .
Round n: R(p_1), R(R(R(p_2))) . . .

## Security
The security of this cipher scheme depends on the preimage resistance of H(x) in known-plaintext attacks. Additionally, it assumes that from H(x) or H(k|x) for any k â‰  n, it is impossible to predict H(n|x).

To construct an ideal H(x), you can combine multiple hash functions from various families like so:
H(x) = keccak(x) xor BLAKE(BLAKE2(BLAKE3(x))) xor SHA256(x)

Rationale and considerations for constructing H(x):
- provides security, even if one of the families of hash functions is thoroughly broken
- various hashes have a limited output space, xoring multiple different families helps to increase the output space to be closer to 256-bit
- makes it extremely difficult to undo.

## Implementation
Coming soon.
